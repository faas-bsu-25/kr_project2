                        <p>
                            Usually when I crack open some code for an assignment--or even for a lab in here--I can
                            breeze through it without much trouble.

                            But trying to make a whole game like this? It's so hard to find a good way to write this
                            code. I was about to make subclasses of a
                            <code>PickupItem</code> where the scripts only contained class names. How on earth did my
                            line of reasoning get to <i>that?</i>

                        <p>
                            I spent a lot of time figuring out how I wanted to approach the singleton pattern for this
                            game. Godot features a built-in singleton system via "Project Settings > Globals" aka
                            "Autoload"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went back and forth on whether to make each specialized singleton a child node of a
                            higher-level GameManager class. Ultimately I decided against it. While asking the BSU Game
                            Dev Discord server about putting all signals in one file or putting related signals into
                            each manager. Manager. Dr. Gestwicki was kind enough to

                            that the word "Manager" is meaningless. He offered, "The name 'manager' means 'I don't know
                            what this does :)" Ánd, he's right. This prompted me to rename my singletons. Exit,
                            <code>PickupManager</code>. Enter, <code>PickupEventBus</code>. ✨

                        <p>
                            I wasn't very good at trig. So. Radians threw me for a loop even when converting to/from
                            degrees. I tried multiple times for the sword to swing at an angle perpendicular to the
                            mouse position, but it was horribly inconsistent.

                            I eventually decided for the sword to swing in the last axis movement direction. This vector
                            is only updated if the player is actively moving at the time of the check.

                        <p>
                            Remember that issue I had where I needed to defer the call to change the pickup's animation
                            in accordance with a change of type......
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yeah it was really hard to get the pot to spawn it because once again the pot made the
                            pickup try to change its type before the whole thing had loaded. Rahhhh.
                        </p>
                        <p>I eventually figured it out, though.</p>

                        <summary>Scene Tile Woes and Smart Snap Prose (10/17)</summary>
                        <p>
                            I was VERY excited to turn my pot into a scene tile. It was gonna be so easy. I click, I
                            click, boom, pot. HOWEVER...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Apparently, if a scene tile has export variables, they cannot be accessed when the scene is
                            placed as a tile. For something like floor spikes which are generally self-contained, this
                            is fine. For the pots, on the other hand, they are completely reliant on editable drops. A
                            dealbreaker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately, smart snap exists. You know how, as you move elements in a slide on PowerPoint,
                            those orange lines will snap your element to align with the top, bottom, or middle of other
                            elements? That's what smart snap does. Generally, it makes lining up hand-placed scenes with
                            their tile friends much easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>This pot, despite looking perfectly like a tile....is entirely separate. Yay.</p>

                        <summary>Bombs were a Lot Harder to Make than You Think (10/18)</summary>
                        <p>
                            Okay. So. you place a bomb. The fuse burns for a couple seconds. The bomb explodes. What
                            next?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Naturally, the bomb explodes and notifies the <code>TileEventBus</code>, "hey, I just
                            exploded these tiles." This is very similar to the logic used for the sword swinging at
                            objects. Easy enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>The catch.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The bomb can't <code>queue_free()</code> itself to soon or it won't get a chance to
                                announce which tiles it exploded.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The bomb can't trust the <code>TileEventBus</code> to <code>queue_free()</code> it. For
                                some really weird reason, after the first bomb explodes it gets unreliable, and each
                                bomb added to the scene before the previous is freed causes massive delays in the
                                <code>TileEventBus</code> whether the bomb announced any tiles or not. And heaven forbid
                                the bombs try to blow up the other bombs.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Eventually I decided on a second timer on the bomb. The bomb hides itself, activates its
                            hurtbox, hangs around long enough to play the explosion sound, and finally
                            <code>queue_free()</code>s itself. PHEW.
                        </p>

                                    As a side note, I was going to make explosion particles, but it was too hard to try
                                    to fit them to the aesthetic. I settled for a neat red fade-in that intensifies the
                                    closer the bomb gets to exploding. I'm proud of that one.

                        <summary>Bouts of Burnout and migrating Readme (10/27)</summary>
                        <p>
                            Since the start, I have written my README in HTML. The "Assets Used" section uses images
                            wrapped in hyperlinks, and in order to do this <i>and</i> make them all the same height,
                            HTML was the only way. Late last week, I discovered how easy it is to deploy a static
                            webpage to a GitHub repository, so here we are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for the burnout, I haven't touched this project in over a week. I had set out to get
                            alllll my other homework done last week to leave all the time needed to crank out the rest
                            of this project. And then I just... didn't touch it...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's a lot that goes into that. Longstanding issues, the death of a friend over this past
                            weekend, and old habits dying hard. I will get it done. I will find a way. I always do. Just
                            maybe not right now.

                        <p>
                            I've had my doubts thus far about how clean my code is, but the process of making an enemy
                            class went really well. The Enemy combines the preset functions granted unto Pickups by
                            their tool script as well as the loot drop system granted unto Pots by <i>their</i> tool
                            script. My experience with knowing when to use <code>Callable#call_deferred()</code> has
                            made the whole ordeal far easier to debug.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am quite pleased. We're almost onto real level design and beyond!</p>
